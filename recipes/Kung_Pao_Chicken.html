<h2>How to Make Kung Pao Chicken</h2>
<p>Making Kung Pao chicken is a straightforward process. Follow these steps for a delicious meal:</p>
<ol>
    <li>In a medium bowl, <em>combine</em> the cornstarch, water, 1 tablespoon of the white wine, 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil. Add the chicken pieces and toss to coat. Let it marinate for at least 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, <strong>mix together</strong> the chili paste, brown sugar, vinegar, remaining white wine, remaining soy sauce, and remaining sesame oil. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. <em>Add</em> a bit of oil and stir-fry the chicken until it's cooked through and slightly browned. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
    <li>In the same skillet, <em>add</em> a bit more oil if needed. Stir-fry the garlic until fragrant. Add the water chestnuts and cook for another minute.</li>
    <li>Return the chicken to the skillet. Pour in the <strong>sauce mixture</strong> and stir well to coat everything evenly. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens.</li>
    <li>Stir in the chopped peanuts and green onions. Cook for an additional minute.</li>
