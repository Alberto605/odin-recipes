# Odin Recipes

This is a basic HTML project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.  
The goal of this project is to build a simple recipe website using only HTML.

By the end of this project, I will have practiced:
- Creating and structuring HTML documents
- Working with lists, links, and images
- Organizing a multi-page website
- Using relative paths for navigation between pages

This project will be revisited later to add styling with CSS.
