# Odin Recipes

This project is a simple recipe website built using basic HTML. The goal was to practice project structure and fundamental HTML concepts such as headings, lists, links, and images.

Throughout the project, I completed the following tasks:
- Set up the initial project structure with an `index.html` homepage.
- Created individual recipe pages within a dedicated directory, each containing structured content.
- Added images, descriptions, ingredient lists, and step-by-step instructions for each recipe.
- Implemented navigation links between the homepage and recipe pages for seamless user experience.
- Expanded the site by adding multiple recipes with consistent page layouts.

By completing this project, I demonstrated skills in:
- Organizing and structuring a web project effectively.
- Using semantic HTML elements to create accessible content.
- Managing relative file paths for navigation.
- Incorporating multimedia and list elements for clear information presentation.

This project reinforced foundational web development skills and prepared me for more advanced projects in the future.
